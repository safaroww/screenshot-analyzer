# App Store Description — Terms of Use (EULA) Section

Apple requires that apps offering auto‑renewable subscriptions include clear Terms of Use. Add the following to the end of your App Store Description (both emoji and no‑emoji variants):

---

TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY

• Terms of Use: https://safaroww.github.io/screenshot-analyzer/terms-of-use.html
• Privacy Policy: https://safaroww.github.io/screenshot-analyzer/privacy-policy.html
• Apple Standard EULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/

Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto‑renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

Copy the section above into App Store Connect → App Information → Description.

Notes:
- Also set “Privacy Policy URL” and (optionally) “Support URL” in App Store Connect to the same hosted pages.
- Keep the links live and accessible (GitHub Pages hosting is fine).
